          <h3>Poverty vs. Healthcare, Obesity, Smoking</h3>
          <p>As poverty increases, there seems to be a lack of healthcare increases, obesity rates increase, and more money is spend on smoking.
          </p>
          <h3>Age vs. Healthcare, Obesity, Smoking</h3>
          <p>As age increases there is a trend towards decrease in healthcare and obesity, but increase in smoking. This dataset doesn't seem to
            include enough data to make a final recommendation, just that there does seem to be some correlation.
          </p>
          <h3>Income vs. Healthcare, Obesity, Smoking</h3>
          <p>As Income increases, both obesity and lack of healthcare decrease. There doesn't seem to be a correlation between income and 
            smoking.
